Here's a quick reference to the datasets available in this folder, most of them are either downloaded from Kaggle
 or the UCI website.

        Downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/download
        This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.
        In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date.
        The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no
        presence) to 4.
